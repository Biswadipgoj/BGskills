# Handoff — BISWODIP-GOJ-UNIFIED-ENGINEERING

_Last updated: 2026-09-26T12:30:00.000Z_

Read this first. Verify section 2 against the repository (`git status`, run the build) before trusting it, then continue from section 6.

## 1) Goal

<!-- biswodip:goal -->

Maintain the Biswodip Goj Unified Engineering system: one evidence-driven operating system for AI coding agents, installable from GitHub as a set of small skills, orchestrating five upstream projects (Taste, Emil Kowalski, No AI Slop, Headroom, Strix) under one release gate.

- **Objective:** an agent can be pointed at any repository and take it from "it runs" to "explained, verified, monitored, recoverable" — with every claim backed by a recorded command, result and artifact.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - `node bin/biswodip.mjs verify-package` passes with zero FAILED.
  - `node --test test/tooling.test.mjs` passes.
  - The installer clones **all five** upstream repositories, verifies each, and never duplicates what is already installed.
  - Every skill's `SKILL.md` stays under the context budget (14,000 chars ≈ 3.5k tokens).
  - The v1.2.0 material is preserved verbatim in `references/`, including all 2,215 verification gates.
  - Upstream licences and notices are never modified; attribution holds.
- **Out of scope:** modifying anything under `upstream/` by hand; certifying legal compliance; promising any software is unhackable; running security tests against targets the user has not authorized.

## 2) Current state

<!-- biswodip:state -->

<!-- biswodip:auto:start -->

> Facts below are refreshed by `biswodip handoff update`. Everything outside this block is written by hand — do not let the tool own your reasoning.

- **Version:** 2.3.0 — git repository on branch `main`, remote `origin` = github.com/Biswadipgoj/BISWODIP-ENGINEERING-skills.
- **Package self-verification:** VERIFIED — 78/84, 0 FAILED. 6 UNVERIFIED = the five omitted upstream snapshots (this is the core-build copy; `upstream/.snapshots-omitted` present) plus PowerShell parsing.
- **Tests:** 49/53 pass. The 4 failures are all environmental in this core-build copy (bundled-snapshot checks + offline/full install need the omitted `upstream/` snapshots or network) — not regressions.

<!-- biswodip:auto:end -->

- **Lifecycle phase:** 13 — release, plus in-flight distribution work (the portfolio site).
- **Builds / tests:** `verify-package` → 0 FAILED. `npm test` → 49/53 (4 expected snapshot/install failures, see above). Site `tsc --noEmit` → clean; static export exists in `site/out/` (full `next build` is slow — three.js-heavy).
- **Verified by running (this session):** re-ran `generate-site-capabilities.mjs` — no drift, catalog and `site/src/data/capabilities.ts` in sync (89 capabilities, 45 required); `tsc --noEmit` clean across `page.tsx` + all 3D components; `verify-package` 0 FAILED.
- **UNVERIFIED:** PowerShell `.ps1` parsing (no `pwsh` here — CI covers Windows). A fresh full `next build` — exceeds the sandbox's ~3-min per-call cap; compiles under `tsc` and a prior static export exists.
- **BLOCKED:** nothing.
- **OPEN:** the site is not yet deployed (Vercel config `site/vercel.json` present); README CI badge depends on Actions being green on `origin`.

## 3) Active files

<!-- biswodip:files -->

| File | Role | State |
|---|---|---|
| `MASTER-PROMPT.md` | The operating system, §0–§43. Canonical source of the router skill. | Stable — edit here, never in `skills/` |
| `skills-src/*.md` | Body of each of the 7 skills (frontmatter is generated). | Stable |
| `scripts/lib/skills.mjs` | Skill catalogue: which files each skill carries, budget check. | Stable |
| `scripts/lib/core.mjs` | Detect / install / verify engine — clone, retries, pinning, snapshot fallback, lock file. | Stable |
| `scripts/lib/gates.mjs` | Secret rules, risk heuristics, dependency audits, evidence output. | Stable |
| `scripts/lib/strix.mjs` | Guarded pentest runner (target guard, `run.json` verdict). | Stable |
| `scripts/lib/handoff.mjs` | This file's tooling. | New in 2.1.0 |
| `integrations/manifest.json` | Pinned commits, expected paths, skill lists, install strategies. | Regenerate with `refresh-snapshots` |
| `upstream/**` | Exact vendored snapshots of 5 repos. | **Do not edit.** Regenerate only |
| `references/01–06` | v1.2.0 content, verbatim. | **Do not rewrite.** Add, don't replace |

## 4) Changes made

<!-- biswodip:changes -->

1. **v2.0.0 — rebuilt from v1.2.0.** Merged the master operating prompt with the old 531 KB `SKILL.md`; split that file verbatim into `references/01–06` (line-by-line check: every non-empty line survives, 2,215 gates intact); added §41 AI/LLM security, §42 agent self-safety, §43 writing quality.
2. Built `lifecycle/00–13`, `security/` (6 deep-dives), `reports/` (7 templates), `integrations/` (5 briefs + manifest + guarded Strix runner).
3. Vendored all five upstream repos into `upstream/` via `git archive` at recorded commits; tree hashes in `upstream/SNAPSHOTS.json`.
4. Wrote the tooling: `bin/biswodip.mjs` + `scripts/lib/*` (detect, install, verify, gates, strix, package verify, snapshot refresh) and `.sh`/`.ps1`/`.mjs` entry points for the four scripts.
5. Relicensed from MIT to **Apache-2.0 under Biswodip Goj**, added `NOTICE`, corrected `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (v1.2.0 wrongly claimed Emil Kowalski's repo had no licence — it is MIT).
6. Fixed v1.2.0 defects: missing YAML frontmatter, `citeturn0view0` corruption, literal `\n` escapes, duplicate section numbers, a reference to a `run-local-pentest.ps1` that did not exist, automatic `npm install` into the user's project, no retries or verification in the installer, a stale `.tgz` inside the package.
7. **v2.1.0 — context surgery.** Split the monolith into 7 GitHub-installable skills; the router's `SKILL.md` went from ~12,900 to ~1,365 tokens on trigger (−89%). Added `handoff.md` tooling, `docs/GITHUB.md`, `docs/CONTEXT-BUDGET.md`, and a per-skill budget check in `verify-package`.
8. Evidence: `.biswodip/evidence/` in any project the tooling runs against; the build ran `verify-package`, `node --test`, a live pinned install, an offline install, and the Strix guard checks.
9. **v2.2.0 / v2.3.0 — distribution + orchestration.** Added the `/dip` entry layer and installers (v2.2.0), then auto-planning, specialist subagents and the `/dip-setapi` LLM gateway (v2.3.0). See `CHANGELOG.md`.
10. **Portfolio site + catalog expansion (2026-09-26, commit `3169fe7`).** Expanded `integrations/catalog.json` with 44 top-starred repos (89 capabilities, 45 required) via `scripts/add-top-starred.mjs`; the catalog is the single source of truth. `scripts/generate-site-capabilities.mjs` → `site/src/data/capabilities.ts` → `scripts/wire-site-capabilities.mjs` wires it into `site/src/app/page.tsx`. Added the Next.js site under `site/` (React 18, framer-motion, three.js, Tailwind; 3D visuals; static export). Catalog + scripts propagated to all 7 `skills/biswodip-*` mirrors. `.kilo/` (Kilo Code worktree metadata) is now gitignored.

## 5) Failed attempts

<!-- biswodip:failed -->

- **`node --test test/` and bare `node --test`** — the first failed with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on Node 22; the second auto-discovered `upstream/headroom/sdk/typescript/test/**` and tried to run vendored Vitest suites (34 failures that were not ours). Fixed by naming the file: `node --test test/tooling.test.mjs`. If you add a test file, add it to the `test` script explicitly — do not go back to directory discovery.
- **`rsync` for the upstream snapshots** — not installed in the build container. `git archive HEAD | tar -x` is better anyway: it exports exactly the tracked files at the commit, with no `.git` and no local dirt.
- **Checking the `skills` CLI flags from npm** — `npm view skills` returns `403 Forbidden` behind the proxy. Read the flags from the `vercel-labs/skills` README instead. Do not assume registry access exists.
- **Delivering the full 42.8 MB zip in chat** — rejected, 30 MiB limit. Now shipped as a 396 KB core build plus two split parts; `scripts/lib/package.mjs` understands an `upstream/.snapshots-omitted` marker so the core build still verifies honestly instead of reporting FAILED.
- **PowerShell validation** — no `pwsh` in the container and it cannot be installed through the proxy. Left as `UNVERIFIED` rather than assumed-good; the CI matrix parses the `.ps1` files on Windows.
- **Installing `headroom-ai` automatically when a `package.json` exists** (inherited from v1.2.0) — that silently mutates the user's dependencies. Removed; now opt-in behind `--with-headroom-sdk`.
- **Scanning everything under `.claude/skills` in the gates** — 36 vendored skills produced hint noise that buried the real planted finding. Those directories are now excluded unless `--include-skills` is passed.

## 6) Next steps

<!-- biswodip:next -->

1. **Deploy the portfolio site.** `site/` has `vercel.json` and produces a static export; wire it to Vercel (or GitHub Pages) and confirm the live build matches `tsc`/local export. When editing capabilities, edit `integrations/catalog.json` then re-run `generate-site-capabilities.mjs` + `wire-site-capabilities.mjs` — never hand-edit `capabilities.ts`.
2. **Push and confirm CI green** on `origin/main`; the README badge resolves only after Actions passes.
3. **Verify the install path from GitHub** in a scratch project: `npx skills add Biswadipgoj/BISWODIP-ENGINEERING-skills`, then confirm the skill folders appear in `.claude/skills` and the router triggers by description.
4. **Run the Windows leg** once: `scripts\install-integrations.ps1 -Root .` and `integrations\strix\run-local-pentest.ps1 -DryRun` on a real Windows host, then move PowerShell parsing from UNVERIFIED to VERIFIED.
5. **Exercise Strix end to end** on a disposable local app with Docker running and `STRIX_LLM` / `LLM_API_KEY` set — confirm `run.json` classification for a findings run (exit 2) and a clean one.
6. **Refresh upstream** before any release: `node bin/biswodip.mjs refresh-snapshots` then `verify-package`. Never refresh immediately before shipping.
